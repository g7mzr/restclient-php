# PHP RestFULL PHP CLIENT

## Introduction

I wrote this module to allow testing of the [Webtemplate](https://github.com/g7mzr/webtemplate)
RestFull API using [phpunit](https://phpunit.de/).

It is of course possible to use the module to access other websites using the RestFull
API providing all the data is passed using JSON.

## Installation

To load the latest release add the following to your composer.json file

    {
        "require": {
            "g7mzr/restclient-php": "*"
        },
        "repositories": [
            {
                "type": "vcs",
                "url":  "https://github.com/g7mzr/restclient-php.git"
            }
        ]
    }

To load the development version add the following to your compose.json file

    {
        "require": {
            "g7mzr/restclient-php": "dev-master"
        },
        "repositories": [
            {
                "type": "vcs",
                "url":  "https://github.com/g7mzr/restclient-php.git"
            }
        ]
    }
